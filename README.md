# Taktus

An open-source solution for production scheduling and optimization.

## About Taktus

**Taktus** is a powerful, community-driven application designed to help businesses of all sizes streamline their production workflows. Using **advanced optimization algorithms**, Taktus creates efficient manufacturing schedules, manages resources, and reduces bottlenecks.

The name "Taktus" is inspired by the concept of "Takt time," a core principle of lean manufacturing that refers to the required production rate to meet customer demand. Our goal is to provide a flexible and robust tool that brings this principle to life for any industry.

## Features

- **Resource Management:** Optimize the use of equipment, personnel, and materials.
- **Production Scheduling:** Generate efficient production schedules to minimize changeover times.
- **Demand-Driven Planning:** Align production output directly with customer demand.
- **Open-Source & Extensible:** Built on Python, making it easy to contribute to and adapt for specific needs.
